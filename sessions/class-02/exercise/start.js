// 🧸 Here's a class with ES6 syntax
// 🧸 Remember it is just syntactic sugar around JavaScript's prototypal inheritance.
class SomeClass {
	constructor() {
		this.name = 'Dragons';
	}

	sayDragon() {
		return this.name.toUpperCase();
	}
}

// 💰 Convert the above class with JavaScript's Function
export function SomeFunction() {
	// 🧸 See what should be the object's own property
}

// 🧸 Also think about methods in prototype chain.
SomeFunction.prototype = {
	// 🧸 See what should come from prototype
};

// 🧸 Let's create a class State
// 🧸 The class instantiation takes an initial state (an object).
// 🧸 The class provides two methods
// 🧸 setState(key, value) which sets the state for the key with the value.
//    If key is not a string, then it should throw an error.
// 🧸 getState(key = null) which gets all the state if key is null, or just the
//    specified property.
//    If key is not null and is not a string, then it should throw an error.
export class State {}

// 🧸 We have a constructor function Cycle.
// 🧸 The purpose is to create a clock which will fire
// 🧸 A callback after given interval.
export function Cycle() {}
// 🧸 With it comes the following methods.
Cycle.prototype = {
	// 🧸 This one sets the interval and callback of the clock.
	init(interval, callback) {
		this.interval = interval;
		this.callback = callback;
		this.intervalId = null;
	},
	// 🧸 This one starts the clock.
	start() {
		this.intervalId = setInterval(this.callback, this.interval);
	},
	// 🧸 This one stops the clock.
	stop() {
		clearInterval(this.intervalId);
	},
};

// 🧸 Now the goal is to create another constructor function
export function CycleEnhanced() {}
// 🧸 This one should inherit from Cycle
// 🧸 And have its own methods
// 🧸 changeCallback - Which will change the callback on the go.
// 🧸 changeInterval - Which will change the interval on the go.
// 💡 The above two methods should clear old interval
//    set the new values and start the clock again.
// 💡 The prototype of CycleEnhanced should inherit the prototype of Cycle.
